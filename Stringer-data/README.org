* Experimental data by Stringer et al

In order to run the Julia analysis scripts of this repository, this directory should contain the original data by Stringer et al (2018).

Data must be downloaded from the reference below, then converted to the ~.dat~ format expected by the Julia scripts by running the [[./convert_exp_files.m][convert_exp_files.m]] Matlab script.

The experimental data has been published in:

- C. Stringer, M. Pachitariu, C. B. Reddy, M. Carandini, and K. D. Harris,
  Recordings of 10,000 neurons in visual cortex in response to 2,800 natural images.   /Janelia Research Campus. Dataset/ (2018). [[https://doi.org/10.25378/janelia.6845348.v4][DOI 10.25378/janelia.6845348.v4]]
